```

## ✨ **Key Features**

### **Smart Extraction Management**
- **No Re-scraping**: Intelligent tracking prevents duplicate work
- **Resumable Operations**: Can stop and continue extraction at any time
- **Progress Persistence**: Maintains progress across application restarts
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient API usage with rate limiting
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures and network issues

### **User-Friendly Interface**
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Clear status icons (✅ complete, 🔄 in progress)
- **Guided Workflows**: Step-by-step prompts and parameter configuration
- **Comprehensive Results Display**: Detailed extraction results and statistics
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Easy access from both main menu and player management

### **Flexible Configuration**
- **Customizable Limits**: Set match extraction limits per player (up to 500+)
- **Force Restart Option**: Start fresh extraction when needed
- **Selective Extraction**: Target specific players or continue incomplete ones
- **Reset Capabilities**: Reset extraction progress for re-scraping

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### **Quick Start**
1. Launch application: `python main.py`
2. Select option 5: \"📜 Historical Match Extraction\"
3. Choose extraction type and configure parameters
4. Monitor progress and results

### **Typical Workflow**
1. **First Extraction**: Use \"Extract for All Players\" with 300-500 matches
2. **Monitor Progress**: Check status regularly during long extractions
3. **Continue Later**: Use \"Continue Incomplete Extractions\" to resume
4. **Targeted Updates**: Use \"Extract for Specific Player\" for individual updates

### **Best Practices**
- Start with 300 matches per player for initial extraction
- Use \"Continue Incomplete\" rather than force restart
- Monitor API rate limits during large extractions
- Check extraction status before starting new extractions

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Core Engine Integration**
The CLI seamlessly integrates with core engine methods:
- `engine.historical_match_scraping()` - Main extraction functionality
- `engine.get_extraction_status()` - Status monitoring and progress tracking
- `engine.reset_player_extraction()` - Reset functionality for re-scraping

### **Menu Methods Added**
```python
# Main extraction interface
def _historical_match_extraction(self) -> None

# Extraction sub-options
def _extract_all_players(self) -> None
def _extract_specific_player(self) -> None
def _continue_incomplete_extractions(self) -> None

# Status and management
def _view_extraction_status(self) -> None
def _reset_player_extraction(self) -> None

# Utility methods
def _display_extraction_results(self, results: dict) -> None
```

## 📝 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: First-Time Extraction**
```
python main.py
→ 5 (Historical Match Extraction)
→ 1 (Extract for All Players)
→ 300 (matches per player)
→ N (don't force restart)
→ Monitor progress and results
```

### **Example 2: Continue Incomplete**
```
python main.py
→ 2 (Manage Players)
→ 7 (View extraction status)
→ Check incomplete players
→ 6 (Historical match extraction)
→ 3 (Continue Incomplete Extractions)
→ 100 (additional matches)
```

### **Example 3: Specific Player Update**
```
python main.py
→ 5 (Historical Match Extraction)
→ 2 (Extract for Specific Player)
→ Select player from list
→ 200 (matches to extract)
→ N (don't force restart)
```

The historical match extraction functionality is now fully accessible through the user interface, providing powerful deep data analysis capabilities while maintaining the intelligent extraction tracking that prevents redundant work and ensures efficient operation.
