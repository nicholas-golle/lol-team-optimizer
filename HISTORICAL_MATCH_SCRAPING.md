# Historical Match Scraping System

This document describes the enhanced historical match scraping system that tracks extraction ranges and prevents re-scraping of already extracted data.

## Overview

The historical match scraping system provides deep historical data extraction with intelligent tracking to avoid wasting time re-extracting matches that have already been processed. It supports incremental extraction, persistent tracking, and can handle very large match histories (500+ matches per player).

## Key Features

### 1. **Extraction Range Tracking**
- **Persistent Tracking**: Tracks what ranges of matches have been extracted for each player
- **Incremental Extraction**: Continues from the last extraction point
- **Avoid Re-scraping**: Never re-extracts matches that are already stored
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking and completion status

### 2. **Deep Historical Data**
- **Large Match Histories**: Supports extraction of 500+ matches per player
- **Batch Processing**: Processes matches in configurable batches (default 20)
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting to respect API constraints
- **Error Recovery**: Continues extraction despite individual match failures

### 3. **Persistent State Management**
- **Extraction Tracker**: Stores extraction progress in `extraction_tracker.json`
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Maintains state across application restarts
- **Reset Capability**: Can reset extraction progress for re-scraping if needed
- **Status Monitoring**: Comprehensive status reporting and progress tracking

## Data Models

### PlayerExtractionRange

```python
@dataclass
class PlayerExtractionRange:
    puuid: str                                    # Player identifier
    start_index: int = 0                         # Starting index of extracted range
    end_index: int = 0                           # Ending index (exclusive)
    total_matches_available: Optional[int] = None # Total matches from API
    last_extraction: Optional[datetime] = None   # Last extraction timestamp
    extraction_complete: bool = False            # Extraction completion status
    
    @property
    def matches_extracted(self) -> int:
        """Number of matches extracted."""
        return self.end_index - self.start_index
    
    @property
    def extraction_progress(self) -> float:
        """Progress of extraction (0.0 to 1.0)."""
        if self.total_matches_available is None:
            return 0.0
        return min(1.0, self.matches_extracted / self.total_matches_available)
```

### ExtractionTracker

```python
@dataclass
class ExtractionTracker:
    player_ranges: Dict[str, PlayerExtractionRange]  # PUUID -> extraction range
    last_updated: Optional[datetime] = None          # Last update timestamp
    
    def get_extraction_summary(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Get summary of extraction progress for all players."""
        return {
            'total_players': len(self.player_ranges),
            'completed_players': sum(1 for r in self.player_ranges.values() if r.extraction_complete),
            'total_matches_extracted': sum(r.matches_extracted for r in self.player_ranges.values())
        }
```

## Core Methods

### Historical Match Scraping

```python
def historical_match_scraping(self, player_names: Optional[List[str]] = None, 
                            max_matches_per_player: int = 500,
                            force_restart: bool = False) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Perform historical match scraping with extraction tracking.
    
    Features:
    - Tracks extraction ranges to avoid re-scraping
    - Continues from last extraction point
    - Supports up to 500+ matches per player
    - Persistent progress tracking
    """
```

### Extraction Status Monitoring

```python
def get_extraction_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get comprehensive extraction status for all players.
    
    Returns detailed information about:
    - Extraction progress for each player
    - Completion status
    - Next extraction points
    - Summary statistics
    """
```

### Extraction Management

```python
def reset_player_extraction(self, player_name: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Reset extraction progress for a specific player."""

def get_next_extraction_batch(self, puuid: str, batch_size: int = 20) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Get the next batch of matches to extract for a player."""

def update_player_extraction_progress(self, puuid: str, matches_fetched: int, 
                                    total_available: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
    """Update extraction progress for a player."""
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Historical Scraping

```python
from lol_team_optimizer.core_engine import CoreEngine

engine = CoreEngine()

# Scrape historical data for specific players
results = engine.historical_match_scraping(
    player_names=['PlayerName1', 'PlayerName2'],
    max_matches_per_player=300
)

print(f"New matches stored: {results['total_new_matches']}")
print(f"Duration: {results['duration_minutes']:.2f} minutes")

# Check results for each player
for player, stats in results['player_results'].items():
    print(f"{player}: {stats['new_matches_stored']} new matches")
    print(f"  Total extracted: {stats['total_matches_extracted']}")
    print(f"  Progress: {stats['extraction_progress']:.1%}")
```

### 2. Extraction Status Monitoring

```python
# Get comprehensive extraction status
status = engine.get_extraction_status()

print("Extraction Summary:")
print(f"  Total players: {status['summary']['total_players']}")
print(f"  Completed players: {status['summary']['completed_players']}")
print(f"  Total matches extracted: {status['summary']['total_matches_extracted']}")

# Detailed player status
for player_name, details in status['players'].items():
    print(f"{player_name}:")
    print(f"  Matches extracted: {details['matches_extracted']}")
    print(f"  Extraction complete: {details['extraction_complete']}")
    print(f"  Next extraction start: {details['next_extraction_start']}")
```

### 3. Incremental Extraction

```python
# First run - extracts initial batch
results1 = engine.historical_match_scraping(['PlayerName'], max_matches_per_player=100)
print(f"First run: {results1['total_new_matches']} matches")

# Second run - continues from where first run left off
results2 = engine.historical_match_scraping(['PlayerName'], max_matches_per_player=100)
print(f"Second run: {results2['total_new_matches']} matches")

# The system automatically continues from the last extraction point
```

### 4. Reset and Re-scrape

```python
# Reset extraction progress for a player
reset_result = engine.reset_player_extraction('PlayerName')
print(f"Reset successful: {reset_result['success']}")

# Re-scrape from the beginning
results = engine.historical_match_scraping(
    ['PlayerName'], 
    max_matches_per_player=200,
    force_restart=True  # Alternative way to restart
)
```

## Storage Architecture

### File Structure

```
data/
├── matches.json              # Centralized match database
├── match_index.json          # PUUID-based match index
├── extraction_tracker.json   # Extraction progress tracking
└── players.json              # Player database
```

### Extraction Tracker Format

```json
{
  "last_updated": "2025-07-28T15:24:09.137476",
  "player_ranges": {
    "player_puuid_1": {
      "puuid": "player_puuid_1",
      "start_index": 0,
      "end_index": 166,
      "total_matches_available": null,
      "last_extraction": "2025-07-28T15:24:09.137476",
      "extraction_complete": false
    }
  }
}
```

for i, match_id in enumerate(new_match_ids):
    # Fetch match details
    match_detail = self.riot_client.get_match_details(match_id)
    
    # Rate limiting between requests
    time.sleep(1)  # 1 second between batches
```

### 2. **Smart Extraction Logic**

```python
def get_next_extraction_range(self, batch_size: int = 20) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """Get the next range to extract."""
    if self.extraction_complete:
        return self.end_index, 0
    
    # Calculate remaining matches if total is known
    if self.total_matches_available is not None:
        remaining = self.total_matches_available - self.end_index
        count = min(batch_size, remaining)
    else:
        count = batch_size
    
    return self.end_index, count
```

### 3. **Progress Calculation**

```python
@property
def extraction_progress(self) -> float:
    """Progress of extraction (0.0 to 1.0)."""
    if self.total_matches_available is None or self.total_matches_available == 0:
        return 0.0
    return min(1.0, self.matches_extracted / self.total_matches_available)
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Track

```python
# Extraction status monitoring
status = engine.get_extraction_status()
print(f"Completion rate: {status['summary']['completion_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Total matches extracted: {status['summary']['total_matches_extracted']}")

# Individual player progress
for player, details in status['players'].items():
    print(f"{player}: {details['extraction_progress']:.1%} complete")
```

### Maintenance Operations

```python
# Reset extraction for re-scraping
engine.reset_player_extraction('PlayerName')

# Force restart extraction
engine.historical_match_scraping(['PlayerName'], force_restart=True)

# Monitor extraction progress
status = engine.get_extraction_status()
```

## Future Enhancements
