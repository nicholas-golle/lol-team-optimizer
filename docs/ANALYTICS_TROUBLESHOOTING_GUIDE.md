## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Performance Profiling and Optimization

#### Identifying Performance Bottlenecks

**Using Built-in Profiling Tools:**
```python
# Enable performance profiling in analytics settings
analytics_engine.enable_profiling = True

# Run analysis with profiling
result = analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance(puuid, filters)

# View profiling results
analytics_engine.display_performance_report()
```

**Common Bottlenecks and Solutions:**

1. **Database Query Performance**
   ```sql
   -- Check for missing indexes
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM matches WHERE puuid = ? AND match_date > ?;
   
   -- Add appropriate indexes
   CREATE INDEX idx_matches_puuid_date ON matches(puuid, match_date);
   ```

2. **Memory Usage Issues**
   ```python
   # Monitor memory usage
   import psutil
   process = psutil.Process()
   print(f"Memory usage: {process.memory_info().rss / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
   
   # Use streaming for large datasets
   for batch in analytics_engine.stream_analysis(filters, batch_size=100):
       process_batch(batch)
   ```

3. **Cache Inefficiency**
   ```python
   # Check cache statistics
   cache_stats = analytics_engine.cache_manager.get_statistics()
   print(f"Cache hit rate: {cache_stats.hit_rate:.2%}")
   
   # Optimize cache keys
   analytics_engine.cache_manager.optimize_cache_keys()
   ```

#### System Resource Monitoring

**Memory Monitoring:**
```python
def monitor_memory_usage():
    """Monitor memory usage during analytics operations."""
    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.start()
    
    # Run analytics operation
    result = analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance(puuid, filters)
    
    # Get memory statistics
    current, peak = tracemalloc.get_traced_memory()
    print(f"Current memory usage: {current / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    print(f"Peak memory usage: {peak / 1024 / 1024:.2f} MB")
    
    tracemalloc.stop()
```

**CPU Profiling:**
```python
import cProfile
import pstats

def profile_analytics_operation():
    """Profile CPU usage of analytics operations."""
    profiler = cProfile.Profile()
    profiler.enable()
    
    # Run analytics operation
    result = analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance(puuid, filters)
    
    profiler.disable()
    stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
    stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
    stats.print_stats(10)  # Show top 10 functions
```

### Data Integrity and Validation

#### Comprehensive Data Validation

**Match Data Validation:**
```python
def validate_match_data_integrity():
    """Comprehensive match data validation."""
    validation_results = {
        'total_matches': 0,
        'valid_matches': 0,
        'issues_found': []
    }
    
    for match in match_manager.get_all_matches():
        validation_results['total_matches'] += 1
        
        # Check for required fields
        if not all([match.match_id, match.puuid, match.champion_id]):
            validation_results['issues_found'].append(
                f"Missing required fields in match {match.match_id}"
            )
            continue
        
        # Check for reasonable values
        if match.kills < 0 or match.deaths < 0 or match.assists < 0:
            validation_results['issues_found'].append(
                f"Invalid KDA values in match {match.match_id}"
            )
            continue
        
        # Check game duration
        if match.game_duration < 300 or match.game_duration > 7200:  # 5 min to 2 hours
            validation_results['issues_found'].append(
                f"Unusual game duration in match {match.match_id}: {match.game_duration}s"
            )
        
        validation_results['valid_matches'] += 1
    
    return validation_results
```

**Statistical Validation:**
```python
def validate_statistical_calculations():
    """Validate statistical calculation accuracy."""
    # Test with known datasets
    test_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    
    # Test confidence interval calculation
    ci = statistical_analyzer.calculate_confidence_intervals(test_data, 0.95)
    expected_mean = 5.5
    assert abs(ci.mean - expected_mean) < 0.01, "Confidence interval calculation error"
    
    # Test significance testing
    sample1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    sample2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    test_result = statistical_analyzer.perform_significance_testing(sample1, sample2)
    assert test_result.p_value < 0.05, "Significance test should detect difference"
    
    print("✅ Statistical calculations validated successfully")
```

### Error Recovery and Resilience

#### Graceful Error Handling

**Implementing Retry Logic:**
```python
import time
from functools import wraps

def retry_on_failure(max_retries=3, delay=1.0):
    """Decorator to retry failed operations."""
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            last_exception = None
            
            for attempt in range(max_retries):
                try:
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                except Exception as e:
                    last_exception = e
                    if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                        time.sleep(delay * (2 ** attempt))  # Exponential backoff
                        continue
                    break
            
            raise last_exception
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@retry_on_failure(max_retries=3)
def robust_analytics_operation(puuid, filters):
    """Analytics operation with retry logic."""
    return analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance(puuid, filters)
```

**Fallback Mechanisms:**
```python
def analyze_with_fallback(puuid, filters):
    """Analytics with fallback to simpler methods."""
    try:
        # Try advanced analysis first
        return analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance(puuid, filters)
    except InsufficientDataError:
        # Fallback to basic analysis with relaxed requirements
        relaxed_filters = filters.copy()
        relaxed_filters.minimum_games = 3
        return analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance_basic(puuid, relaxed_filters)
    except StatisticalError:
        # Fallback to non-statistical analysis
        return analytics_engine.analyze_player_performance_simple(puuid, filters)
```
