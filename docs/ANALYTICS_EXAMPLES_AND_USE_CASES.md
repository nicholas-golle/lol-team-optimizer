## Individual Player Analysis

### Use Case 1: Identifying Your Best Champions

**Scenario:** You want to identify which champions you perform best with to focus your ranked play.

**Steps:**
1. Access "Champion Performance Analytics" from the main menu
2. Select your player profile
3. Set date range to last 60 days (recent performance)
4. Set minimum games to 5 (for statistical relevance)
5. Review results sorted by performance delta

**Example Results:**
```
Champion Performance Analysis - Summoner: ProPlayer123
Analysis Period: 2024-06-01 to 2024-07-31 (60 days)

Top Performing Champions (vs. Personal Baseline):
1. Jinx (ADC)     - Win Rate: 73% (11W-4L) - Performance Delta: +15.2%

### Use Case 18: Custom Analytics Dashboard

**Scenario:** Create a custom dashboard for specific team needs and metrics.

**Implementation:**
```python
class CustomTeamDashboard:
    """Custom analytics dashboard for team-specific needs."""
    
    def __init__(self, team_config):
        self.team_config = team_config
        self.widgets = self._initialize_widgets()
    
    def _initialize_widgets(self):
        """Initialize dashboard widgets based on team preferences."""
        return {
            'team_performance_trend': TeamPerformanceTrendWidget(),
            'individual_rankings': IndividualRankingsWidget(),
            'champion_pool_analysis': ChampionPoolAnalysisWidget(),
            'upcoming_matches': UpcomingMatchesWidget(),
            'practice_recommendations': PracticeRecommendationsWidget()
        }
    
    def render_dashboard(self):
        """Render the complete dashboard."""
        dashboard_html = """
        <div class="team-dashboard">
            <div class="dashboard-header">
                <h1>Team Analytics Dashboard</h1>
                <div class="last-updated">Last Updated: {timestamp}</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="dashboard-grid">
                {widgets}
            </div>
        </div>
        """.format(
            timestamp=datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"),
            widgets=self._render_all_widgets()
        )
        
        return dashboard_html
```
