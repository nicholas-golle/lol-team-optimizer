# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Gradio Web Interface system transforms the existing command-line League of Legends Team Optimizer into a modern, accessible web application. This system provides an intuitive graphical user interface that makes all optimization and analytics features available through a web browser, enabling easier collaboration, better visualization, and improved user experience for team managers, coaches, and players.

The system will maintain full feature parity with the CLI while adding enhanced visualization capabilities, real-time collaboration features, and mobile-responsive design. It will serve as the primary interface for most users while maintaining the CLI for advanced users and automation scenarios.
