# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will streamline the League of Legends team optimization application by consolidating redundant functionality and simplifying the user interface. The system currently has multiple overlapping interfaces (CLI, Jupyter notebook, Colab setup) with excessive menu depth and scattered functionality. The goal is to create a unified, streamlined interface that reduces complexity while maintaining all core optimization capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want a single unified interface that combines player management and team optimization, so that I can accomplish all tasks without navigating through multiple menus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL present a streamlined interface with no more than 4 main options
2. WHEN managing players THEN the system SHALL allow adding, viewing, and optimizing in a single workflow
3. WHEN optimizing teams THEN the system SHALL automatically handle player selection and preference management inline
4. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show all relevant information (assignments, champions, synergies) in one comprehensive view

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to eliminate redundant interfaces and setup processes, so that I can use the application through a single consistent entry point.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide only one primary interface (streamlined CLI)
2. WHEN setting up the application THEN the system SHALL use a single setup process that works for all environments
3. WHEN accessing functionality THEN the system SHALL not duplicate the same features across multiple interfaces
4. WHEN using Jupyter/Colab THEN the system SHALL provide a simplified notebook that calls the main interface rather than reimplementing features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want player management integrated directly into the optimization workflow, so that I don't need to navigate separate menus to add players and set preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting team optimization THEN the system SHALL allow adding new players inline if needed
2. WHEN a player lacks preferences or data THEN the system SHALL prompt for this information during optimization setup
3. WHEN viewing optimization results THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust player data and re-optimize without returning to main menu
4. WHEN managing existing players THEN the system SHALL provide quick access to update preferences and refresh data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want consolidated result displays that show all relevant information at once, so that I don't need to navigate through multiple views to understand the optimization outcome.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying optimization results THEN the system SHALL show role assignments, individual scores, champion recommendations, and synergy data in one comprehensive view
2. WHEN showing player analysis THEN the system SHALL include performance data, champion mastery, and role suitability in a single display
3. WHEN presenting alternatives THEN the system SHALL show multiple team compositions side-by-side for easy comparison
4. WHEN explaining decisions THEN the system SHALL provide reasoning inline with results rather than in separate explanations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want smart defaults and automatic data fetching, so that I can get results quickly without extensive manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a player THEN the system SHALL automatically fetch available API data and set reasonable default preferences
2. WHEN optimizing with incomplete data THEN the system SHALL use intelligent defaults and clearly indicate what data is missing
3. WHEN API data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to preference-based optimization with clear notifications
4. WHEN preferences are not set THEN the system SHALL use performance-based role suitability as defaults

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simplified menu structure with no more than 4 main options, so that I can quickly access the functionality I need without deep navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the main menu THEN the system SHALL present exactly 4 options: Quick Optimize, Manage Players, View Analysis, and Settings
2. WHEN selecting Quick Optimize THEN the system SHALL handle player selection, data fetching, and optimization in one streamlined flow
3. WHEN managing players THEN the system SHALL provide add, edit, remove, and bulk operations in a single interface
4. WHEN viewing analysis THEN the system SHALL show player comparisons, team analysis, and historical data in one consolidated view

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to eliminate code duplication between interfaces, so that maintenance is simplified and functionality is consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL use shared core logic rather than duplicating functionality across interfaces
2. WHEN updating functionality THEN changes SHALL be reflected consistently across all access points
3. WHEN adding new features THEN they SHALL be implemented once in the core system and exposed through the unified interface
4. WHEN maintaining the codebase THEN there SHALL be no more than one implementation of any given feature
