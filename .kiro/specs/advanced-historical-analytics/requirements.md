# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Advanced Historical Analytics & Champion Recommendations system builds upon the existing historical match extraction functionality to provide deep insights, advanced analytics, and intelligent champion recommendations based on actual match performance data. This system transforms raw historical match data into actionable intelligence for team optimization, champion selection, and performance analysis.

The system will analyze historical match data to identify patterns, calculate performance metrics relative to player baselines, and provide sophisticated champion recommendations that consider team composition synergies, individual player performance, and historical success rates across different scenarios.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Historical Match Data Viewing and Analysis Interface

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want to view and analyze historical match data for my players, so that I can understand their performance patterns and make informed decisions about team composition and champion selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

3. WHEN a user applies filters (date range, champion, role, outcome) THEN the system SHALL update the match list to show only matches meeting the criteria
4. WHEN a user views match statistics THEN the system SHALL display aggregated metrics including win rates, average performance scores, and trend analysis
5. IF a user requests match export THEN the system SHALL generate downloadable reports in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Excel)

### Requirement 2: Advanced Champion Performance Analytics

**User Story:** As a coach, I want to analyze champion performance across different contexts and team compositions, so that I can identify the most effective champion choices for specific situations and player combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user analyzes champion performance THEN the system SHALL calculate performance metrics relative to the player's baseline performance across all champions
2. WHEN analyzing champion-role combinations THEN the system SHALL show performance statistics including win rate, KDA, CS/min, vision score, and damage metrics compared to player averages
3. WHEN evaluating team composition impact THEN the system SHALL analyze how champion performance varies based on teammate champion selections and roles
4. WHEN calculating champion synergies THEN the system SHALL identify champion combinations that perform significantly better or worse than individual baselines
5. IF insufficient data exists for analysis THEN the system SHALL indicate confidence levels and sample sizes for all statistics

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Champion Recommendation Engine

**User Story:** As a player, I want to receive champion recommendations based on my historical performance and current team composition, so that I can select champions that maximize my team's chances of success.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests champion recommendations THEN the system SHALL analyze historical performance data to suggest champions ranked by expected performance
2. WHEN team composition is partially selected THEN the system SHALL adjust recommendations based on synergy analysis with already-selected champions
3. WHEN calculating recommendation scores THEN the system SHALL weight individual performance, team synergy, recent form, and meta considerations
4. WHEN displaying recommendations THEN the system SHALL show confidence scores, expected performance metrics, and reasoning for each suggestion
5. IF a user requests alternative recommendations THEN the system SHALL provide multiple recommendation strategies (safe picks, high-ceiling picks, counter-picks)

### Requirement 4: Team Composition Historical Analysis

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to analyze how different team compositions have performed historically, so that I can identify optimal team setups and understand the impact of different champion combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing team compositions THEN the system SHALL identify all historical instances of specific player-champion-role combinations
2. WHEN calculating composition success rates THEN the system SHALL compare team performance against individual player baselines to identify synergy effects
3. WHEN evaluating role combinations THEN the system SHALL analyze how specific player pairings perform in different role combinations (e.g., Player A top + Player B jungle)
4. WHEN displaying composition analysis THEN the system SHALL show win rates, performance deltas, sample sizes, and statistical significance
5. IF composition data is limited THEN the system SHALL suggest similar compositions and extrapolate insights from related data

### Requirement 5: Player Performance Baseline and Comparative Analysis

**User Story:** As a performance analyst, I want to establish performance baselines for each player and analyze how they perform relative to these baselines in different contexts, so that I can identify factors that enhance or diminish player performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating player baselines THEN the system SHALL establish average performance metrics across all champions, roles, and time periods with appropriate weighting
2. WHEN analyzing contextual performance THEN the system SHALL compare performance in specific situations (champion, role, teammates) against established baselines
3. WHEN identifying performance factors THEN the system SHALL correlate performance variations with team composition, champion selection, and temporal factors
4. WHEN displaying comparative analysis THEN the system SHALL show performance deltas, percentile rankings, and trend analysis
5. IF baseline data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL use appropriate statistical methods to handle small sample sizes and provide confidence intervals

### Requirement 6: Advanced Statistical Analysis and Insights

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to perform sophisticated statistical analysis on historical match data, so that I can uncover hidden patterns, validate hypotheses, and generate actionable insights for team improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing statistical analysis THEN the system SHALL provide correlation analysis, regression modeling, and significance testing capabilities
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL identify performance patterns over time, meta shifts, and seasonal variations
3. WHEN calculating confidence intervals THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate statistical measures for all performance metrics and recommendations
4. WHEN identifying outliers THEN the system SHALL flag unusual performances and investigate potential causes or data quality issues
5. IF statistical assumptions are violated THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate corrections and clearly communicate limitations

### Requirement 7: Interactive Analytics Dashboard

**User Story:** As a team manager, I want an interactive dashboard that allows me to explore historical data dynamically, so that I can quickly answer specific questions and drill down into areas of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the analytics dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide interactive visualizations for key performance metrics and trends
2. WHEN filtering data THEN the system SHALL update all visualizations and statistics in real-time to reflect the selected criteria
3. WHEN drilling down into data THEN the system SHALL allow users to navigate from summary statistics to detailed match information
4. WHEN comparing metrics THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side comparisons of players, champions, time periods, and team compositions
5. IF data visualization fails THEN the system SHALL provide alternative data presentation methods and clear error messages

### Requirement 8: Historical Data Integration and Performance

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the analytics system to efficiently process large volumes of historical match data, so that I can get insights quickly without system performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
